# Trips ETL Pipeline
An ETL process using the framework [Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/) to orchestrate the flux.


## Installation

First the docker-compose must be installed, that can be found [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).



## Usage

The next step is to run the docker-compose command in the terminal, inside the project folder to build the environment.

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

After it builds, you must wait until the container mobi7postgres_1 be ready to connection. You can see that inside the container if you are using the docker hub interface.

- password: airflow

Since the DAG is triggered monthly, you must trigger it manually in the actions column.

- Sistema: PostgreSQL
- Servidor: mobi7postgres
- Usu√°rio: postgres
- Senha: postgres
